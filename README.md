👋, Nice to see you.
Im Yhana1601 also known as lalang, and I'm a top GitHub committer with 5 years of expertise in Security and Web development. I'd want to educate new programmers how to understand their route and design a suitable roadmap so that they may become IT professionals. My main objective is to enable young programmers in the Philippines have access to inexpensive learning materials.
